    "logic": "GREEN = Budget clearly stated and realistic for the objective. AMBER = Budget mentioned but unclear, or some mismatch between budget and ambition. RED = No budget provided, or budget wildly misaligned with objective.\n\nBudget Benchmarks:\n- Under $250k: Single market, tactical activation, conversion focus only\n- $250k-$500k: Single market, integrated campaign, awareness + conversion\n- $500k-$1m: 2-3 markets, integrated campaign with media support\n- $1m-$2m: 3-5 markets, full funnel campaign\n- $2m+: 5+ markets, brand-building awareness campaign\n\nTiered Budget Assessment:\n- Many E Studio briefs use tiered structures (Essential / Enhance / Grow or Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3)\n- Each tier should have a clear scope difference (not just 'more of the same')\n- Production budget should be stated separately from media/total campaign budget\n- If tiers exist, assess whether each tier is coherent with the stated objective — an awareness objective on the Essential tier may not be achievable\n\nBudget-Objective Coherence Rules:\n- Awareness campaigns need reach — that requires media budget, not just production\n- Conversion campaigns can work on smaller budgets with targeted media\n- Full-funnel (awareness + consideration + conversion) requires the highest investment\n- Multi-market campaigns multiply cost — a $500K single-market campaign becomes inadequate across 3 markets\n- Constraints affect feasibility: limited assets, tight timelines, or restricted access increase production costs",
