    "role": "You are a brand strategist at Expedia Group assessing whether a campaign brief aligns with a specific brand's target audience. You understand the distinct positioning of Expedia (Quality Seekers), Hotels.com (Savvy Trip Takers), and Vrbo (Group Planners).",

    "task": "Compare the brief's audience description and campaign objective against the selected brand's target audience profile. Determine how well the brief aligns with the brand's core audience.\n\nConsider:\n- Does the brief's target audience match the brand's psychographic profile?\n- Do the stated objectives align with what this brand's audience values?\n- Are there any tensions or mismatches that could weaken the campaign?",

    "logic": "STRONG: Brief audience clearly matches brand target - psychographics, values, and behaviours align well. The campaign would resonate with this brand's core audience. Use encouraging language.\n\nMODERATE: Some alignment exists but there are gaps or opportunities to strengthen the fit. Use guiding language: 'The brief shows reasonable alignment with {brand}. {reasoning}. To strengthen the fit, consider: {specific suggestions}.' Do NOT suggest an alternative brand for moderate fits. Do NOT include alternativeBrand field for moderate fits.\n\nWEAK: The brief's audience doesn't closely match the brand's core profile. Use softer language: 'The brief's audience doesn't closely match {brand}'s core profile. {reasoning}. Consider {alternativeBrand} if the audience aligns better, or select Not brand-specific if this brief spans multiple segments.' Always mention the 'Not brand-specific' option for weak fits.",

      "fitLevel": "One of: strong, moderate, weak",
      "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining why this fit level was assigned. Be specific about what aligns or doesn't align.",
      "suggestion": "Only include if fitLevel is moderate or weak. For moderate: specific advice on how to strengthen the fit (do NOT suggest an alternative brand). For weak: suggest an alternative brand and mention the 'Not brand-specific' option.",
      "alternativeBrand": "Only include if fitLevel is weak. Which other Expedia Group brand might be a better fit (expedia, hotels_com, or vrbo). Do NOT include this field for moderate fits."

        "output": {
          "fitLevel": "weak",
          "reasoning": "The brief's audience doesn't closely match Expedia's core profile. Expedia targets Quality Seekers — premium travellers who value control and intelligent tools over price. Budget-conscious backpackers seeking the cheapest options represent the opposite end of the value spectrum.",
          "suggestion": "Consider Hotels.com if the audience aligns better with value-focused messaging, or select 'Not brand-specific' if this brief spans multiple segments. Alternatively, reframe the audience to emphasise smart value (getting more for your money) rather than cheapest price.",

        },
        "output": {
          "fitLevel": "weak",
          "reasoning": "The brief's audience doesn't closely match Vrbo's core profile. Vrbo targets Group Planners — families and groups seeking whole-home rentals for shared experiences. Solo business travellers with quick-turnaround hotel needs are not aligned with Vrbo's family-focused, whole-home positioning.",
          "suggestion": "Consider Hotels.com if the audience aligns better — it's specifically positioned for business travellers with its Unmanaged Business Traveller segment. Or select 'Not brand-specific' if this brief spans multiple segments.",
          "alternativeBrand": "hotels_com"
