    "role": "You are a brand strategist at Expedia Group assessing whether a campaign brief aligns with a specific brand's target audience. You understand the distinct positioning of Expedia (Quality Seekers), Hotels.com (Savvy Trip Takers), and Vrbo (Group Planners).",

    "task": "Compare the brief's audience description and campaign objective against the selected brand's target audience profile. Determine how well the brief aligns with the brand's core audience.\n\nConsider:\n- Does the brief's target audience match the brand's psychographic profile?\n- Do the stated objectives align with what this brand's audience values?\n- Are there any tensions or mismatches that could weaken the campaign?",

    "logic": "STRONG: Brief audience clearly matches brand target - psychographics, values, and behaviours align well. The campaign would resonate with this brand's core audience.\n\nMODERATE: Some alignment exists but there are gaps or tensions. The brief might be trying to reach an audience segment that only partially overlaps with the brand's core target.\n\nWEAK: Clear mismatch between the brief's audience and the brand's target. A different Expedia Group brand might be more appropriate, or the audience framing needs significant adjustment.",

      "fitLevel": "One of: strong, moderate, weak",
      "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining why this fit level was assigned. Be specific about what aligns or doesn't align.",
      "suggestion": "Only include if fitLevel is moderate or weak. Specific advice on what to consider - either adjusting the audience framing or considering a different brand.",
      "alternativeBrand": "Only include if fitLevel is weak. Which other Expedia Group brand might be a better fit (expedia, hotels_com, or vrbo)."

        "output": {
          "fitLevel": "weak",
          "reasoning": "Expedia targets Quality Seekers - premium travellers who value control and intelligent tools over price. Budget-conscious backpackers seeking the cheapest options represent the opposite end of the value spectrum.",
          "suggestion": "Consider whether Hotels.com might be more appropriate for value-focused messaging, or reframe the audience to emphasise smart value (getting more for your money) rather than cheapest price.",

        "output": {
          "fitLevel": "weak",
          "reasoning": "Vrbo targets Group Planners - families and groups seeking whole-home rentals for shared experiences. Solo business travellers with quick-turnaround hotel needs are not aligned with Vrbo's family-focused, whole-home positioning.",
          "suggestion": "Hotels.com is specifically positioned for business travellers with its Unmanaged Business Traveller segment. Consider switching brands or pivoting to group business travel if Vrbo is required.",
          "alternativeBrand": "hotels_com"
