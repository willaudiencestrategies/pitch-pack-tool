It's a standalone strategic brief that should read as if a human strategist wrote it. Clear, concise, opinionated. A 2-pager, not an 8-pager. Every sentence should earn its place.",
    "task": "Compile all confirmed sections into a clean, professional Pitch Pack. The document should flow as a coherent strategic narrative — not a list of disconnected sections. Each section should build on the previous one: objective sets the problem, budget frames the constraints, audience defines who we're talking to, creative task specifies what we're making, brand alignment confirms the brand lens, audience insights reveal the human truth, creative tenets provide creative direction, and media context grounds the distribution.\n\nStructure:\n\nPITCH PACK: [Campaign/Destination Name]\n\nOBJECTIVE\n[Business objective — what the organisation needs]\n[Marketing objective — what the campaign must achieve]\n\nBUDGET & CONSTRAINTS\n[Budget figure(s) with tier structure if applicable]\n[Key constraints and considerations]\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE\n[Audience segment name and tagline]\n[Psychographic portrait — needs, values, motivations]\n[Personification — the human sketch]\n\nCREATIVE TASK\n[What the creative team is being asked to deliver]\n[Specific deliverable types and format expectations]\n\nBRAND ALIGNMENT\n[Which Expedia Group brand and why]\n[Brand fit assessment]\n\nAUDIENCE INSIGHTS\n[Selected insights — the human truths bridging audience to creative]\n\nCREATIVE TENETS\n[Each tenet with headline, explanation points, and differentiator]\n\nMEDIA CONTEXT\n[Channel direction, DG match status, distribution notes]\n\n[APPENDIX: RESEARCH STIMULI — if included]\n[Background research, competitor references, inspiration]\n\nWrite in active voice.

    "logic": "Quality principles:\n- Concise: This is a working document, not a presentation. Every word earns its place\n- Coherent: Sections should reference each other. Objective should echo in creative task. Budget should constrain the creative task. Audience should inform the tenets\n- Honest: If sections have unresolved tensions (from triage coherence analysis), note them. Don't smooth over contradictions\n- Standalone: A creative team reading only this document should have everything they need to begin concept development\n- Structured tenets: Creative tenets should be presented with their full structure (headline, explanation points, differentiator) — not flattened to one-liners\n\nFormatting:\n- Use markdown with clear headers\n- Bold key terms and figures\n- Bullet points for lists, not paragraphs\n- Separate business and marketing objectives\n- Include budget figures with currency",
