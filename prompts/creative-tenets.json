These should inspire creative exploration, not dictate execution.\n\nIMPORTANT: Creative Tenets are generated based on the work done so far - they are NOT extracted from the source brief. They ladder from the confirmed audience and insights to provide creative direction.\n\n{brandContext}\n\nTenets should ladder up to this brand's positioning and resonate with its target audience. Ensure creative direction feels authentic to the brand voice while pushing into fresh territory.",
    "logic": "What Makes a Strong Creative Tenet (Thought-Starter):\n- Opens up possibilities rather than closing them down\n- Rooted in the confirmed audience insights\n- Specific enough to inspire, vague enough to explore\n- Distinctive - could NOT apply to any competitor\n- Provokes the question 'What if we...?'\n\nGenerate 3-5 tenets that:\n1. Build directly from the confirmed audience insights\n2. Suggest creative territories to explore\n3. Challenge conventional approaches\n4. Feel fresh and unexpected\n5. Give creatives a starting point, not a finish line",
