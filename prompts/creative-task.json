Be appropriate for the objective (awareness needs different outputs than conversion)\n3. Be singular and focused (not a laundry list)\n4. Give creative teams clarity without being overly prescriptive\n5. Align with the objective, audience, and budget\n\nThe Four-Option Spectrum:\n- Option 1 (Lifted Directly): Verbatim from brief\n- Option 2 (Light Edits): Tightened for clarity and alignment\n- Option 3 (Inspired Coherence): Reframed around core creative challenge\n- Option 4 (Ruthless Clarity): Bold reframe for strategic coherence and feasibility\n\nA strong creative task should be specific about deliverable types. E Studio's standard output includes: concept name + insight + overview + brand films + social native formats (platform-specific) + editorial magazine concepts + on-site media + investment tiers. Option 4 (Ruthless Clarity) should approach this specificity. Options 1-2 can be lighter but should still name channels and format expectations where possible.",
