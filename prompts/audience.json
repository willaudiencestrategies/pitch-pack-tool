    "logic": "What You're Looking For:\n- The destination (explicit or implied)\n- Any target audience mentions (even vague ones)\n- Origin markets for travellers\n- The perceived goal of the campaign\n- Any clues about traveller behaviours, values, needs, or tensions\n\nWhat Makes a Strong Segment:\n- Rich in needs/values/motivations (goes beyond demographics)\n- Inspiring and potentially provocative\n- Commercially viable (not too niche, not too broad)\n- Distinct but not exhaustive\n\nNaming Principles:\n- Snappy and stimulating (1-2 words max)\n- AVOID overused labels: 'Cultural Explorers', 'Globe Trotters', 'Adventure Seekers', 'Luxury Travellers', 'Eco-Tourists', 'Digital Nomads', 'Foodies', 'Thrill Seekers'\n- Stimulate interest rather than describe behaviour\n- Let the description do the heavy lifting",

    "task": "Based on the chosen segment, paint a deeper, more detailed personification of this audience. This should build on the high-level segment with richer human texture.",

    "logic": "What This Is NOT:\n- Not a persona (no 'Julie, 37, accountant from Manchester')\n- Not a demographic profile\n- Not a laundry list\n\nWhat This IS:\nA rich, behavioural and psychological portrait that reveals:\n- The type of traveller they are\n- What they're trying to feel and get out of the experience\n- Who they're travelling with (if relevant)\n- What they prioritise and trade off\n- What earns their trust / triggers scepticism\n- The story they want to be able to tell afterwards\n\nTone: Vivid, behavioural, psychologically insightful, detailed but dynamic (150-300 words)",
